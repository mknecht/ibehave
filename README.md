# ibehave: Jupyter kernel for behave

This is a hacked together proof of concept to demonstrate
a [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook for
[behave](http://pythonhosted.org/behave/).
In particular, I want to discuss how the readability
that *behave* gives can be extended by the
ease for sharing, documenting *and running*
when packaged as a Jupyter notebook.
